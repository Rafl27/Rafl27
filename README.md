## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

If youâ€™re a recruiter interested in the code behind BiteSized, please note that the repository is private. I strongly believe in its potential and am actively working on it. However, Iâ€™m more than happy to discuss and share the code during an interview. This includes diving into the tech stack, infrastructure, architectural decisions, and more.

As for the other projects youâ€™ll find here, they reflect the earlier stages of my career and don't fully represent my current skills.

Feel free to explore BiteSized at [BiteSized App](https://bite-sized-app.vercel.app/home).
